## Data Structres, Algorithms, Java, OO & Miscellaneous Coding Problems
These are custom implementations to just understand the concepts and implement quickly with some assumptions. Covers the following topics:

####1. Data Structures
>    * Linked List
>    * BST
>    * Hashmap
>    * Min Heap

####2. Algorithms
>    * Fibonacci
>    * Prim's
>    * Sorting

####3. Java - Concepts associated with syntactic sugar of java.

####4. OO - Object oriented concepts with Java. Example using the classic zoo and animal kingdom analogy.

####5. Miscellaneous Coding Problems and Their Solutions
>  * Binary Gap
>  * Finding the equilibrium index
>  * Reflection in Java
>  * Java operators
>  * Finding closest points in plane to a point using binary min heap or priority queue.
>  * Finding largest N integers when millions of integers are given using a priority queue or min binary heap.
>  * Finding smallest N integers when millions of integers are given using a priority queue or max binary heap.
>  * Recursion - A child is running up a staircase with n steps, can hop either 1 step, 2 step or steps at a time. Implement a method to count how many possible ways the child can run up the stairs.
>  * Recursion/DP - Finding if a word can be made using periodic table.
>  * Implement an algorithm to print all valid (e.g. properly opened and closed) combinations of n-pairs of parentheses.
