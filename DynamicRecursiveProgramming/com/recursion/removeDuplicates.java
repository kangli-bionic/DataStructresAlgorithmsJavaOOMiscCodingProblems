/**
 * Given a string which only contains lowercase. You need delete the repeated
 * letters only leave one, and try to make the lexicographical order of new
 * string is smallest. i.e: bcabc You need delete 1 'b' and 1 'c', so you delete
 * the first 'b' and first 'c', the new string will be abc which is smallest.
 * 
 * ps: If you try to use greedy algorithm to solve this problem, you must sure
 * that you could pass this case: cbacdcbc. answer is acdb not adcb
 * 
 * Scan the string twice. First scan is do some preprocess, and the second is to
 * get the answer.
